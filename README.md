Project Description

Learning is one of our main priorities, with nowadays situation learning physically becoming really hard to do. So, we launched our website “Sharing knowledge Academy” which is an online learning platform that allows users to learn HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and jQuery. Sharing knowledge academy can contribute to the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4), which aims to "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all." By providing accessible, high-quality educational resources and opportunities online, education websites can help to bridge educational disparities and provide individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to participate in a rapidly evolving global economy and society. Additionally, education websites can also play a role in achieving other SDGs, such as SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), by providing individuals with the tools they need to improve their economic prospects and access to opportunities.

Our website has different pages starting with the home page -index.html - which has the description of the website and a search button so the users can search for anything related to learning or related to our website. Also, we will make images that make it more beautiful and attractive to users. We used Teal, black, and white, and colours on our website. The home page welcomes the users, also there is a footer that lets the user choose either dark mode or light mode depending on the user's preferences.

	Secondly, there is a learning page that contains the available courses that we have provided so far, and each course has an image and its description and a button. Each click takes the user to the course page. For example, once the user clicks on “start” in an HTML course button they will be going to that page to start learning. On that page, there are different lessons starting from the beginner level. Once the user hovers his/her mouse on the picture of the lesson will be shown. It is all the same for CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

	Thirdly, the contact page is in the header where the user can find a form to contact us for any questions, requests, or recommendations. There is a form that requires the user's username, email, and his/her message, and then a submit button. Users play an important role in this platform because feedback will build the best version of our website. 

	Last but not least, “About”. On this page, there are some motivational and Islamic educational videos and above these videos, there is a simple statement that talks about “Sharing knowledge academy”. At the end of the page will be our ethics in this academy. 

	Finally, we will animations, interactions, and visual reactions for more user experience. Moreover, APIs were implemented in our project in presenting the current time and date.
